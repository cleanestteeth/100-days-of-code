# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Thursday August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued to follow the gatsby tutorial I began yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting used to the idea that I'm never going to "get it". Programmers stay confused and rely on the internet and each other for guidance. This is a completely new skill set for me, I'm motivated and excited.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
